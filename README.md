## My process

To begin the project, I initiated the installation of Vite and Tailwind CSS. Once the setup was complete, I proceeded with the step-by-step implementation of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCss
- javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to use Vite for developing frontend projects, and this was my first time utilizing it for building a project.

### Continued development

I think this challenge really helps me understand more about the Tailwind CSS framework, so I will continue my development journey by exploring more frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Vite - install from npm](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Tailwind - Setup + Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) - This framwork helped me to build "NEWS HOME PAGE". I really liked this and will use it going forward.
